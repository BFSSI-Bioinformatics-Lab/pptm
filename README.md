# Project Picture Taking Pilot

## TODO

    - before you begin screen with checkboxes to deal with variety pack, multiple NFT, multiple barcode, etc options
    - need to type in product name (with examples of good and bad)
    - big red button to turn on/off Image upload for when wifi not available. in this case only save the filenames, not the image. can we cache the images so that they're still on the review page?
    - bulk image upload page for when wifi is available. will need to map filenames to DB entries
    - front page
    - review page for backend nightly processing

Behold My Awesome Project!

## Settings

Moved to [settings](https://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/1-getting-started/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy pptp

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest
